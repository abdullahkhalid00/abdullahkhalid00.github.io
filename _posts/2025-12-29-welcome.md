Welcome.

It’s a little ironic I’m writing this at the end of the year, but that’s not the only surprising thing that happened—starting a blog is another. Since I’m here, I might as well introduce myself.

## About me

I’m Abdullah: a developer, an aspiring blogger, and a lifelong gamer. My interest in writing was sparked by the classics. While many are daunted by a thick paperback, I was fascinated by what the pages held.

Long story short: prudence (for lack of a better phrase) led me to pursue a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at the [University of Debrecen](https://www.edu.unideb.hu/) on a scholarship. Life weighed on me during those four years, and I stopped writing except for occasional journal entries.

## Why this blog?

After some time away, I’ve decided to combine my sagacity with passion to create something worth sharing. Expect short posts—daily, weekly, or monthly—on technology, literature, psychology, gaming, and the occasional personal thought.

So, here’s to trying something new and seeing where it leads. If you've read this far, I want to thank you for taking the time and patience.

Abdullah
