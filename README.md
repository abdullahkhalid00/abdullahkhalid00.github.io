# Blog and Portfolio

The personal website, portfolio, and blog of Abdullah Khalid.

## Setup and Usage

### Dependencies

Make sure you have the following installed first.

- `ruby<~3.3.0`
- `jekyll<~4.4.1`
- `bundler<~4.0.3`

> NOTE: I've installed `ruby` on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS via WSL on Windows 10.

Clone the repository and navigate into the root folder.

Run the following commands.

```bash
bundle install
bundle exce jekyll serve
```

This would start a local server on <http://127.0.0.1:4000> where you can demo the website.
